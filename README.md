# I2C  
I2C Protocol Verification – SystemVerilog (EDA Playground)

This repository contains a SystemVerilog-based verification project for the I2C protocol, developed and simulated using EDA Playground.

Top-level Testbench

Test case simulation waveforms

The project demonstrates structured testbench architecture, transaction-level stimulus generation, and protocol-level signal verification for the I2C interface. Waveforms are included to show correct protocol behavior and timing validation.

Developed entirely in SystemVerilog using EDA Playground for simulation and functional verification.
